# Contributing to blueprinted.io

Thank you for your interest in contributing to blueprinted.io!  
We’re building an AI-native, task-driven learning engine that’s here to kill the box-ticking LMS.  
Your contributions—whether code, critique, or field wisdom—help make that vision a reality.

## Who Should Contribute?

This project *needs* both technical builders and learning experts:

- **Coders/Engineers:** Help architect, automate, and optimize the core engine and UI.
- **Learning Professionals:** Pressure-test the methodology, propose task schema changes, and ensure that “proof” actually means something in the real world.
- **Hybrid Thinkers:** If you can speak code *and* learning theory, you’re a unicorn—please get involved!
- **Reviewers:** Even if you’re just here to poke holes, find edge cases, or call out real-world limits, your feedback is welcome.

We want challenge, debate, practical skepticism, and the kind of feedback that makes this work *in reality*, not just on a whiteboard.

## How to Contribute

- **Pull Requests:** Fork the repo, create a feature branch, make your changes, and submit a PR.  
  Please keep PRs focused—one feature or fix per PR is ideal. This includes code, sample data, methodology docs, and edge-case test cases.
- **Issues:** Spot a bug, have a feature request, or want to propose an enhancement? Open an issue!  
  For theory, methodology, or schema debates, tag your issue with `learning-methodology`.
- **Discussions:** For bigger ideas, design debates, or to roast the current state of learning tech, use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/YOURREPO/discussions) (or open an issue tagged `discussion`).

## What Contributions Matter?

- **Code:** Task parsing, data storage, CLI/UI, integration.
- **Schema/Design:** Suggest schema improvements, pressure-test edge cases, or propose “task object” refactors.
- **Review:** Audit sample tasks for realism, test the methodology against actual documentation, or flag theoretical/operational gaps.
- **Content:** Help write better examples, doc pages, and onboarding guides for different audiences.

---

## Code of Conduct

We follow the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/).  
Be respectful. Disagree, but do it with reason, not rage.

---

## Guidelines

- **Scope:** Focus contributions on the core loop: artifact ingestion, task extraction, validation, storage, and retrieval.  
  Out-of-scope: Gamification, SCORM plugin hacks, or marketing integrations (for now).

- **Coding Standards:**  
  - Prefer C# (for CLI/core), JavaScript/TypeScript (for UI), or Python (for ingestion/testing).  
  - Write clear, modular code with comments where needed.  
  - If you add a new dependency, explain why in your PR.

- **Tests:**  
  - All core logic should be covered by unit tests.  
  - If you’re fixing a bug, add a regression test.

- **Docs:**  
  - Update or create documentation for your features.  
  - Keep README and example task objects current.

---

## How to Get Your PR Accepted

- Follow the schema and structure in `/docs` and `/examples`
- Use existing naming conventions and folder layout
- Be clear in your PR description about *what* you’re changing and *why*
- Tag any unresolved issues or TODOs in your code

---

## Want to Help But Not Sure How?

Some good starter tasks:
- Improve task extraction logic or schema
- Add sample ingestion scripts for more doc types (PDF, HTML, etc)
- Enhance CLI usability
- Expand test coverage
- Tidy up documentation or onboarding flow

---

## Practice What We Preach

Blueprinted.io is built on the same principles we enable for learning:

- **Peer review for every change:** All code, documentation, and major config is submitted as a pull request and reviewed by at least one trusted contributor before merging.
- **Transparent validation:** Discussions, reviews, and decisions are open to all and archived for future contributors to learn from.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** No code or policy reaches general availability (GA) without explicit review by maintainers with relevant experience.
- **Continuous improvement:** Every contribution, review, and comment is part of our ongoing evidence of capability—visible, auditable, and open for improvement.

If you want to help build this system, we’ll hold ourselves to the same standard we’re building for the world.
