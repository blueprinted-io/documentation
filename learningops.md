# LearningOps: Building Learning Like Software

Learning is still treated like a project.  
Software used to be too.  
Then it evolved.

What emerged in its place was DevOps, a system of continuous, modular, testable, observable development.  
Learning needs the same shift.

Let’s call it **LearningOps**.

## Learning Is Where Software Was in the 1980s

In the 1980s, software development looked a lot like how learning is built today:
- Massive design documents
- Locked-down scopes
- Big, late launches
- Minimal user feedback
- Painful updates

That model collapsed under its own weight. It was slow, expensive, and produced outputs that often didn’t work.  
Sound familiar?

Software evolved. Learning didn’t.

## Agile in Name, Waterfall in Practice

L&D loves to say it’s “agile.” But what it usually means is:
- Shorter timelines
- More Trello boards
- Faster slide development

What it doesn’t mean:
- Iterative design
- Early, usable output
- Built-in feedback loops
- Lightweight deployment

Agile learning is usually just waterfall, but with a slightly better calendar.

| Agile in Software            | "Agile" in Learning                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Deliver working code early  | Finish course faster               |
| Adapt scope continuously    | Plan in sprints, stick to scope    |
| Validate with real users    | Review with internal stakeholders  |
| Ship incrementally          | Launch all at once                 |

Agile was never about speed. It was about *responsiveness*.  
Learning still isn’t built to respond.

## Software Solved This. Learning Should Be Asking How.

Software development didn’t evolve by accident. It evolved because people were tired of shipping things that didn’t work.

That shift didn’t start with new tools. It started with new thinking.  
Modern software development is now:
- Modular
- Iterative
- Testable
- Observable
- Deployable at speed

Learning could be all of these. But to get there, it needs to stop looking inward and start asking how other fields solved the same problems.

**Talk to your dev team. Talk to your ops team.**

Ask:
- How do you scope work in a way that survives change?
- How do you test before release?
- How do you deploy updates safely?
- How do you track value over time?

They’ve already built the answers. We just have to translate them.

## What LearningOps Looks Like

LearningOps applies software logic to learning work.  
Not the code, the structure.

| Software Practice          | LearningOps Equivalent                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Microservices             | Atomic, reusable learning objects        |
| API-first design          | Tool-agnostic content design             |
| CI/CD pipelines           | Instant deployment of learning updates   |
| Unit tests                | Embedded feedback and knowledge checks   |
| Feature flags             | Targeted learning release by role/context|
| Observability             | Real-time learning telemetry             |
| Dev environments          | Safe-to-fail learning pilots             |

This is not metaphor. It is direct process adaptation.  
If L&D worked like product teams, learning would evolve constantly instead of launching and dying.

## The LearningOps Stack (Minimum Viable Version)

You don’t need an engineering budget. You need a shift in structure.

1. **Modular Asset Library**  
   Learning content is broken into the smallest meaningful units. Think single-purpose assets, not slide decks.

2. **Outcome-First Mapping**  
   Each object ties to a real task or capability. No “awareness” modules. No generic overviews.

3. **Delivery-Agnostic Tools**  
   Assets can appear in Teams, intranet pages, email, LMS, Slack, help widgets — wherever needed.

4. **Feedback Loop**  
   Each object has a built-in way to learn if it worked: a click-through rate, a knowledge check, a flag for review.

5. **Iterative Deployment**  
   Learning gets released, tested, and improved. The old “launch once and archive” model is retired.

## Talk to Developers, Not Vendors

The next time a platform vendor says “we support agile learning,” ask them what their dev team uses to deploy software.

The answer won’t be SCORM, and it definitely won’t be a three-week storyboard approval cycle.

If you want to rebuild learning, stop asking for features.  
Start asking how good teams actually work.

## Is Your Practice Ready for LearningOps?

| Question                                             | If Yes...                   | If No...                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Can you update one part of a course without breaking the rest? | You’re modular             | You’re monolithic               |
| Do you track actual outcomes, not just completions? | You’ve got observability    | You’re still reporting vanity metrics |
| Can you deploy new content in less than a day?       | You have CI/CD logic        | You’re in batch-and-blast mode  |
| Do you test your learning assets in the real world?  | You’ve got test coverage    | You’re shipping and praying     |
| Can SMEs or leads suggest updates directly?          | You’re iterative            | You’re locked in design silos   |

## Final Word

LearningOps isn’t a new platform or another framework.  
It’s a return to what already works — modular, maintainable, responsive systems, designed for change.

Software stopped being a thing you shipped once.  
It became a thing you maintain, improve, and observe.

Learning should be the same.

If L&D wants to matter, it needs to stop building learning like a one-off and start treating it like a product.  
Talk to your devs.  
Steal their playbook.  
And start building learning like it actually matters.
