# LearningOps: Building Learning Like Software

Learning is still treated like a project.  
Software used to be too.  
It evolved.

What eventually emerged in its place was Devops, a system of continuous, modular, testable, observable development.  
Learning needs the same shift.

Let’s call it **LearningOps**.

## Learning Is Where Software Was in the 1980s

In the 1980s and 1990s, software was built using the **Waterfall model**.

It looked like this:
1. Plan everything up front  
2. Write long requirement documents  
3. Build it all at once  
4. Test it at the end  
5. Release it in a giant launch  
6. Hope it works

That might sound familiar.

It’s how many learning teams still operate today. Big launches, fixed scopes, everything built up front and reviewed at the end.  

The problem?  
Waterfall only works if you know everything in advance, nothing changes, and people use things exactly as expected.

That was rarely true in software.  
It’s rarely true in learning.

## How Software Evolved

By the early 2000s, dev teams knew the Waterfall approach wasn’t holding up.

They shifted to **Agile**:
- Build in short sprints  
- Deliver early, validate fast  
- Adapt based on feedback  
- Work in cross-functional teams

That solved a lot, but not everything.

Agile improved *how teams built*, not always *how they shipped* or *how they maintained*.

By the 2010s, the evolution continued.  
**DevOps** emerged:
- Development and operations merged into a single flow  
- Code deployed continuously, not in big releases  
- Tests ran automatically  
- Logs and metrics showed how software behaved in real use  
- Teams owned what they built, start to finish

This was the real leap.  
From “build and release” to “build, monitor, maintain, improve.”

Learning hasn’t made that leap yet.

Most teams still build once, launch, and move on.  
There’s little telemetry, no observability, no safe update flow.  
No shared ownership beyond the launch.

DevOps wasn’t just new tooling. It was a reset in how teams thought.  
That’s what learning needs.

## Agile in Name, Waterfall in Practice

L&D loves to say it’s “agile.”  
But most of the time, it just means:
- Shorter timelines  
- Fewer resources 
- Kanban boards instead of Gantt charts

It rarely means:
- Iterative design  
- Early, usable output  
- Real-world feedback  
- Lightweight deployment

Agile learning is often just Waterfall, with better calendar management.

| Agile in Software            | "Agile" in Learning                |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Deliver working code early  | Finish course faster               |
| Adapt scope continuously    | Plan in sprints, stick to scope    |
| Validate with real users    | Review with internal stakeholders  |
| Ship incrementally          | Launch all at once                 |

Agile wasn’t about speed. It was about responsiveness.  
Learning still isn’t built to respond.

## Software Development Solved This

Software didn’t evolve by chance.  
It evolved because people were tired of building things no one used, fixing bugs too late, and guessing what mattered.

The shift didn’t start with tools.  
It started with better questions.

Today, software is:
- Modular  
- Iterative  
- Testable  
- Observable  
- Deployable at speed

Learning could be all those things.

It just has to stop pretending it's unique.  
The challenges learning teams face; unclear requirements, messy stakeholders, no feedback loops, are the same ones software teams faced 30 years ago.

They figured it out.  
We can too.

## What LearningOps Looks Like

LearningOps isn’t theory. It’s a direct application of what already works.

| Software Practice          | LearningOps Equivalent                  |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Microservices             | Atomic, reusable learning objects        |
| API-first design          | Tool-agnostic content design             |
| CI/CD pipelines           | Instant deployment of learning updates   |
| Unit tests                | Embedded feedback and knowledge checks   |
| Feature flags             | Targeted learning release by role/context|
| Observability             | Real-time learning telemetry             |
| Dev environments          | Safe-to-fail learning pilots             |

This isn’t metaphor.  
If L&D operated like product teams, content wouldn’t be something you launch and forget. It’d be something you maintain, monitor, and improve — all the time.

## The LearningOps Stack (Minimum Viable Version)

You don’t need a huge platform or a technical team.  
You need structure.

1. **Modular Asset Library**  
   Break content into the smallest meaningful parts.  
   One task = one object.

2. **Outcome-First Mapping**  
   Every asset ties to a real capability or task.  
   No vague objectives. No fluff.

3. **Delivery-Agnostic Tools**  
   Assets live in LMS, Slack, Teams, SharePoint — wherever people are.

4. **Feedback Loop**  
   Each asset tracks whether it worked.  
   Think usage data, knowledge checks, or signal-based updates.

5. **Iterative Deployment**  
   Content is versioned and updated like a product, not archived like a PowerPoint.

This isn’t complicated.  
It just requires intent.

## Talk to Developers, Not Vendors

Next time a vendor says their platform supports “agile learning,” ask them how their *engineering team* ships software.

It won’t be completion based like SCORM.  
It won’t be a six-week storyboard approval cycle.  
It definitely won’t be a launch-and-leave mindset.

If you want to rebuild learning, stop asking vendors for new features.  
Start asking developers how they solved the same problems we’re facing now.

They’ve already built the blueprint. We just need to follow it.

## Is Your Practice Ready for LearningOps?

| Question                                             | If Yes...                   | If No...                        |
|------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Can you update one part of a course without breaking the rest? | You’re modular             | You’re monolithic               |
| Do you track actual outcomes, not just completions? | You’ve got observability    | You’re still reporting vanity metrics |
| Can you deploy new content in less than a day?       | You have CI/CD logic        | You’re in batch-and-blast mode  |
| Do you test your learning assets in the real world?  | You’ve got test coverage    | You’re shipping and hoping      |
| Can SMEs or leads suggest updates directly?          | You’re iterative            | You’re locked in design silos   |

## Final Word

LearningOps isn’t a new platform or framework.  
It’s a shift toward systems that actually work; modular, testable, maintainable, designed for change.

Software stopped being a one-time build.  
It became something teams evolve, observe, and own.

Learning can be the same.

If you’ve been stuck launching content that disappears, guessing what worked, or trying to improve things with no real feedback? You’re not the problem. The system is.

The good news? That system can change.

Talk to your devs.  
Steal their playbook.  
Start building learning like it actually matters.
