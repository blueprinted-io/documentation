# SCORM, xAPI, and cmi5: What They Actually Are and What You Actually Get

In the world of digital learning, few topics generate as much buzz and confusion as **SCORM**, **xAPI**, and **cmi5**. You’ve probably heard someone say, “We’re moving away from SCORM to xAPI,” or “We’re building for the future with cmi5.” But what do these standards *really* give you?

This article cuts through the jargon to explain, in plain terms, what these standards are, what problems they solve, and what limitations they still carry.

## SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model)

### What It Is
A legacy standard from the late 1990s/early 2000s, SCORM is a packaging and tracking format that lets you launch eLearning content from an LMS and track basic completion data.

### What You Actually Get
- Content that can launch and run inside an LMS
- Tracking for:
  - Completion
  - Pass/fail
  - Score
  - Time spent
- Bookmarking (i.e., resume where you left off)
- Widespread LMS support

### What You *Don’t* Get
- Any tracking outside the LMS/browser
- Insight into what learners are actually doing beyond “completed” or “passed”
- Compatibility with modern learning formats (apps, VR, offline use)
- Custom tracking or extensibility
- Analytics that are meaningful in modern L&D

SCORM is *stable and known*, but extremely limited. It assumes learning only happens in tidy packages behind login screens. That’s not how people learn.

## xAPI (Experience API, aka Tin Can API)

### What It Is
xAPI is a flexible data format (JSON) and communication standard for tracking *any* learning experience. It moves beyond the LMS and can capture informal, offline, and experiential learning.

### What You Actually Get
- Tracking of learning anywhere: mobile, VR, in-person, simulations, etc.
- Storage of learning records in a Learning Record Store (LRS)
- Custom action verbs like “watched”, “repaired”, “mentored”, etc.
- Decoupling of content from the LMS
- Extensibility for bespoke tracking needs

### What You *Don’t* Get
- A standardized way to launch or structure content
- Completion/pass/fail logic (you have to define it yourself)
- Cohesion — without strict implementation, it becomes a wild west of inconsistent data
- Simplicity — implementing xAPI well requires dev effort and instructional design alignment

xAPI is powerful, but it’s *a toolset, not a solution*. You get raw capability, not plug-and-play usefulness.

## cmi5 (Computer Managed Instruction — 5th attempt)

### What It Is
cmi5 is a specification built on top of xAPI that **reintroduces structure and launchability**, effectively acting as a proper replacement for SCORM.

### What You Actually Get
- LMS-based launch and tracking of content, just like SCORM
- Standardized tracking using xAPI statements (completion, score, pass/fail)
- A defined course structure and start/stop rules
- Cleaner data in the LRS
- Compatibility with modern content while retaining LMS delivery
- Reusable xAPI statements and verbs with expected structure

### What You *Don’t* Get
- SCORM backward compatibility (you’ll need new content)
- A silver bullet — your learning content still needs to be modular and well-structured
- Broad adoption — cmi5 is emerging, but not yet universal

cmi5 is the spec xAPI should’ve shipped with. It closes the gaps and gives you the structure needed for real-world implementation.

## The Real Issue: It’s Not Technical, It’s Cultural

The problem isn’t just SCORM vs xAPI vs cmi5. The real problem is that **modern learning standards only shine when paired with modern learning practices**.

These standards were designed to support:
- Modular, reusable content
- Microlearning and just-in-time delivery
- Data-driven L&D decision making
- Blended, multi-platform learning experiences

But none of that works if you’re still churning out 45-minute “courses” packed into a single file.

### Bottom line:
> **SCORM is dying, xAPI is misunderstood, and cmi5 is underused — because we’re still designing for 2004.**

Switching specs without changing process is like switching your pen and expecting your writing to improve.

## Final Thought

If your team is exploring these standards, don’t just ask *what* they do — ask what you're actually trying to achieve.  
- Need modern, flexible tracking? **xAPI** is your base.  
- Want to replace SCORM responsibly? **cmi5** is the only realistic candidate.  
- Still building traditional eLearning modules with no tracking needs beyond "completed"? **SCORM still works**, but it's not future-proof.
